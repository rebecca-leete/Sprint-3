/* REDESIGNING WEBSITE *\

1. PRIMARY PURPOSE
    To share my experiences and lessons in Phase 0 at EDA, as well as provide a platform for me to practice and experiment with the tools I am learning

2. TARGET AUDIENCE
    Other students in my cohort, the technical staff at EDA, myself! Also future
    EDA students

3. AUDIENCE INTERACTION/EXPERIENCE
    I want the site to clearly demonstrate the techniques I am learning, in a way that is easy to undertsand and replicate. The idea is for my website to provide a resource for other students to refer to. I also want it to be aesthetically resonant with myself.

4. HOW TO CREATE THE EXPERIENCE
    The first thing I want to do is redesign the layout so the page content is easy to read and digest. this includes wider spacing and narrower columns
    The seocnd thing I want to change is the structure of the site map - everyone seems to be doing it differently and I presume this is because there is no obvious or easy way to do it. I intend to create a horizontal nav as part of the header, with drop-down menus for my cultural and technical blog posts.
